Thanks for visiting our site!

My name is [Junu](https://www.twitter.com/junetic) and I'm one of the founders of [UserLook](https://userlook.co). Being a product designer and builder, I know how easy it is to be consumed by your own visions and assumptions without actually learning from real users. In fact, I've conducted and participated in countless user research sessions as a [UX consultant](https://linkedin.com/in/junetic). When it comes to my own projects, however, I still found myself falling into the trap of building and designing too much without getting enough user feedback.

Most people would agree that you need to regularly talk to your users to design and build products they actually use and love. We ourselves couldn't find great ways to do this quickly and easily—which is why we are building [UserLook](https://userlook.co).

I hope you can find some inspiration and tips from this blog to more effectively learn from your users and improve your product and business 🙌😁
