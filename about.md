Thanks for visiting our site!

My name is [Junu](https://www.twitter.com/junetic) and I'm one of the founders of [UserLook](https://userlook.co). Being a product designer and builder, I know how easy it is to be consumed by your own visions and assumptions without actually learning from real users. In fact, I've conducted and participated in countless user research sessions—but still find myself falling into the trap of building without learning from real users. Most people would agree that you need to really understand your users to design and build products they actually use and love. We ourselves couldn't find great ways to do this quickly and easily—which is why we decided to build [UserLook](https://userlook.co).

We hope you can find some inspiration and tips from this blog to better learn from your users and customers for your products and businesses 🙌😁
