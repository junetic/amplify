The best way to convince your team to do some user testing or research is to simply _show_ them.

![show don't tell user testing](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*aXN2jbTBWj5uHPnH "Show don't tell user testing")Imagine you were on Medium’s homepage product team and were:

* Trying to integrate user testing and research into the project, but getting push-back because of resource and time constraints.
* Having difficulty trying to agree on which areas/opportunities to focus on to improve the homepage.

You tried to talk on and on about the business benefits and risk-mitigation of user research. Or how quickly and cheaply you could do it—if we could all agree to just try..

Then you simply showed this [unmoderated user testing](https://blog.userlook.co/remote-user-testing-for-mobile-apps) video to your team:
<iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"width="788.54" height="443" type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRBQlRKT2SE?autoplay=0&fs=0&iv_load_policy=3&showinfo=0&rel=0&cc_load_policy=1&start=0&end=0&origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com"><div><small><a href="https://youtubeembedcode.com/en">youtube embed code</a></small></div><div><small><a href="https://promocode.com.ph/">http://promocode.com.ph/</a></small></div><div><small><a href="https://youtubeembedcode.com/en">youtube embed code</a></small></div><div><small><a href="https://promocode.com.ph/">www://promocode.com.ph/</a></small></div></iframe>
New user visiting Medium’s homepage (we are not affiliated with Medium and the homepage probably changed since 😊).

Here are a few highlights of what your team may have witnessed and realized after watching this short video:

1. Some of the **categories are confusing** (ie ‘Unruly Bodies’) and some context/explanation could be helpful:

> “I’m not really sure what these would mean. It might be helpful to have a dropdown when you hovered over to let you know what you were going to see”

***

2. The **homepage assumes that users already know** what the site is about:

> “I don’t really know what it is. It doesn’t say it’s a news site. It assumes you already know. Maybe if they had a banner telling you what it is..”

***

3. **Credibility of writers and content** isn’t clear especially with the emphasis on membership:

> “I would rather get news from a source that has fact-checking. This just seems like anybody could put up news and content and make it look like news.”

***

These are potential insights from just one new user’s opinion. It gets you _thinking_.. Which other users, if any, will say similar things? What other user and usability issues are there in achieving our business goals for the homepage?

And it certainly will get your team to start thinking as well. The conversation will then shift away from any of your team’s or other stakeholder’s personal opinions. And to the needs and context of target your users.

Then someone will ask:

> _Well how much time and resources do we need allocate to do more of this type of user testing?_

You answer:

> _It took only seconds to setup with results coming in within 24 hours. And it cost less than an UberX ride (or Lyft😊)._

Show, don’t tell.

Try it next time.
